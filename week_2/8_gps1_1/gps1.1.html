    <h1>Navigator</h1>
    <p>The role of the navigator is to keep the broader picture in mind, 
    and direct the pair. Just like the picture, the navigator is the bird at 
    your shoulder giving directions</p>
        
    </div>
     <div id="colum_right"><h1>Driver</h1>
     <p>The role of the driver is to stay focused on the actual code. The driver 
         has their hands on the helm keeping the boat headed on the correct course.
     </p>

     <div class="important"><h1>Why it's important</h1>
     <p>Peer pairing is important because it's used extensively in the industry. 
         For example, you can expect to do some pairing in an interview. It's 
         also really useful to bounce ideas off of each other. Additionally, 
         you can check eachothers work immediatly.
