# U1.W2: Thinking About Time Reflection

* What is your biggest time management challenge with during Phase 0? 

My biggest time management challenge during phase 0 will be staying on task while trying to juggle working full time, friends, family, my girlfriend and personal time. I have become acostume to using much of my free time strengthening my relationships with my loved ones and regenerating by spending time with my own thoughts. With limited time to complete assignments I will also have to focus on completing assignments and not fall into the rabbit hole that is coding information on the internet. 

* How will you combat that? 

I will combat the lack of personal time with loved ones by attempting to take advantage of every minute that I do have free with them and to be present in those moments. It will also ask for their patience and understanding as I am unable to see them. To combat my focus on important aspects I will first complete the assignments as needed and then go back to dive deeper into additional information, time permitting.

* What techniques will you try?

One technique that I will try is mediation. I usually take a biweekly solo bike ride which helps me to appreciate life and do some introspection, but I would like to set aside time daily or weekly to truly just sit and “think about my brain sitting on a cloud”.   Another technique that I will try is work on my “flow” by identifying environments and times of day that I will be least distracted. 

* What is your overall plan for Phase 0?

My overall plan for Phase 0 is to spend at least 10 minutes daily for meditation. I also plan to complete assignments daily after work to attempt to finish before the weekend. I will continue to explain to the people in my life how important this time is and continue to ask for their patience. Additionally, I will continue to search for the best environments and times for me to work distraction free.
