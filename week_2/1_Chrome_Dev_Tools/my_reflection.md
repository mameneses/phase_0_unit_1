* Describe the Document Object Model? What about it makes sense to you? What doesn't? What seems good and bad about it?
The DOM seems to be the framework or foundation to make sense of HTML files and JS. It makes sense that it defines the code elements and maps them in a tree like structure. This is great for me as a learnings because structure is incredible helpful, but itâ€™s that to an advanced coder who is trying to think beyond the simple code, it may be limiting. 

* How did using Chrome Web Tools to look at your site and a wordpress.com site compare?
There is a bunch more JS on the wordprss.com blog and it seemed to be concerned with being able to render in different browsers, while my github site did not.

* Did you find Chrome Web Tools fun, helpful, or a pain to work with?
I can see how the Chrome Web Tools would be fun and helpful especially while testing our own webpage and tweaking it. While it is well organized and intuitive it still takes getting use to and a beginner. It provides a lot of insight into how your code translates to the page with highlighting, which is very helpful as a learner. 

* Did you have an "aha" moments or were any concepts solidified?
My aha moment came while listening to the concept of optimizing load speed and how that was affected by the different elements.
