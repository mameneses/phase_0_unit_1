# U1.W2: Responsive Design Reflection

* What is responsive web design? Do you like it?  Do you think it's a good practice? Why or why not?
  Responsive web design is design based on the pixel width of a screen. It allows for a web page to be look good on any device regardless of the pixel width. While, it is tedious to go through and analyze every change that happens as the pixels become smaller, it is a much better alternative to building an entirely new website in most cases. I do think it is a good practice because it makes it adaptable to any screen size, even ones that have not been invented yet. 

* How do you think smartphones and tablets have changed web design? How do you think new technology will change web design in the future?
  Tablets and smarts phones have created a need to responsive web design and I do think it will change the web design of the future as it because one of the most popular ways to access the internet. 

* How do you think visually impaired people use the web? Can they? Should we design and development for them?
  I do feel that visually impaired people could use the web with the help from audio, I feel the design aspect would have to be very important and with set tracks to simple directional navigation with audio response for the blind. For the less visually impaired make a setting that would automatically increase the font size for more readability would also be helpful.

* What ideas and concepts have resonated with you when learning about the web and design? What seems stupid or doesn't make sense?
  What has really stuck with me most is designing something that is adjusts to its environment and the importance of that as technology changes. 

* Did you find any resources on your own that helped you better understand a topic? If so, please list it.
  I have never thought about design for visually impaired before and I feel that this article gave some good insight on visually impaired design.
